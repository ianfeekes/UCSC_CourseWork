This is the main directory for my cmps111 (operating systems) coursework. 
Each child directory should have a readme and a design document specifying the work and usage
more specifically. 
For assignments 2 and 3 I worked with a partner, Enes Yazgan (awesome guy), and the rest were
done independently. 
This main directory should contain the following: 

-assgn0: Tail program in c written using system calls, functional on freeBSD
-assgn1: Simple shell in c, should work for all system calls, including pipelining
-assgn2: All modified and new files to implement priority scheduling and splatter (random) 
         scheduling on freeBSD
-assgn3: All modified and new files to implement FIFO page replacement on freeBSD
-assgn4: FUSE module used to build a FAT-based file system on freeBSD. requires FUSE installation
         to run program.
