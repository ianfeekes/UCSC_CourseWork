This is the readme for Ian Feekes (ifeekes@ucsc.edu, #1474914) cmps111 assgn1 directory. 
The purpose of this assignment was to build a simple shell. This assignment was completed without a programming partner (all work was done alone).
This directory should contain the following files: 
-lex.l                 File that allows for argument processing
-myshell.c             Builds the shell with system calls on line arguments
-Makefile              Compiles lex.l and myshell.c to create myshell exec.
-README                Assignment details 
-DESIGN.txt            Describes the design of the assignment

To my knowledge everything, including the pipelining performs as desired. 
There shouldn't be any weird quirks or conditions to the program. It outputs 
myshell: as the command prompt, which is different from the freebsd $: prompt
but this can easily be changed - I kept it that way so that assessing the program
becomes easier.
