	Throughout this assignment we worked side by side throughout almost the entirity 
of the work. As such, it is difficult to necessarily attribute specific pieces of 
work to one individual. 
	For my time driving, I modified some of the behavior to the inactive queues 
and active queues in the pageout_scan() methods, Enes was driving for the logging
and analyzing of variables, along with other parts of the inactive queue FIFO
implementation. 
	For the documentation, Enes worked more on the design doc and with documenting 
our data and making it into graphs, whereas I worked more on the results doc and 
used my faster computer for benchmarking. 
	In my eyes, we both put in equal work on this assignment. He was a great teammate
and deserves full credit.
