This builds two different executables: cix and cixd, one which acts as
the daemon, a remote server waiting for user input, and the other which
allows manipulation of files between a local and remote directory. You can
have several cix users operating on a single server. 

All work on this assignment done independently (no partner) 
Files to be submitted include:
