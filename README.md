# UCSC_CourseWork-
All work done for BS in CMPS 2015-2019

This repository should contain directories corresponding to each programming
class taken at UCSC. The classes are as follows: 

cmps101: abstract data types

cmps101Redone: abstract data types, but all assignments written
		in C for more experience

cmps109: advanced programming (learning c++)

cmps11: intermediate programming 

cmps111: operating systems (freeBSD, all code is in C)

cmps112: comparative programming languages (scheme, ocaml, 
	  smalltalk, prolog)

cmps115: intro to software development. A simple game written 
	  entirely on Android Studio.

cmps12b: intro to data structures

cmps12bInC: intro to data structures, but all assignments 
	     written in C for more experience 

cmps160: computational graphics. All coding done in javascript, 	   to easily view this work you can go to 
	  people.ucsc/~ifeekes  for each assignment 

NOTE: The github says that my UCSC coursework involves an 
overwhelming amount of javascript. This is not true. Most coursework has been done in C, java, and C++ respectively.
