Readme file for pa2. List.h specifies all the functions and objects to be used in list. List.c has the actual specifications and algorithms for the functions. I had trouble compiling list.c due to it saying "index wasn't of the right type" even though the function specifications in list.c and list.h matched up perfectly. Lex.c reads the input file and works the list functions into the output file as Lex.java in the previous programming assignment worked. This program was accomplished alone, using pretty much only the examples in the ptantalo cs101 site (code for parsing through strings and setting up the input and output files in lex.c was pretty much copied and pasted).
